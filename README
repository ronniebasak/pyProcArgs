This module is designed to simplify the task of Argument processing..
All CLI based applications need Arguments and Process them..

Not standardized, But some various types of Commands are
for e.g
gcc -o a.out example.c
Or 
git --version

So, some common categoris are
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
| Shorthand or single letter mapped args:	    |
| Like -i a.b.c; -o a.b.c.d etc....		    |
|						    |
| Long descriptive mapped args.			    |
| Like --infile a.b.c; --out a.b.c.d etc...	    |
|						    |
| Short Flags:					    |
| Like -h or -v etc.				    |
|						    |
| Long Flags:					    |
| Like --help or --version			    |
|						    |
| Unprocessed Commands:				    |
| Like a.b.c					    |
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Based on this PyProcArgs can map them correctly and can help build a nice 
application w/o the haste of parsing Arguments.

+============================================================================+
NOTE: It is not good for input files. It is correct but Files can start with 
- or -- which will fool PyProcArgs into thinking they are flags or mapped
arguments..

I will upgrade it as soon as I get some free time. Contribution is appreciated
